Title: An Implementation of a SAS-Style Data Step
Version: 0.0.2
Author: Brandon Taylor
Maintainer: Brandon Taylor <brandon.taylor221@gmail.com>
Description: Based on a SAS data step. This allows for row-wise dynamic building
    of data, iteratively importing slices of existing dataframes, conducting
    analyses, and exporting to a results frame. This is particularly useful for
    differential or time-series analyses, which are often not well suited to vector-
    based operations.
Depends: R (>= 3.1.3)
Imports: dplyr (>= 0.5.0), lazyeval (>= 0.1.10), R6 (>= 2.0.1),
        magrittr (>= 1.5), tibble (>= 1.1)
